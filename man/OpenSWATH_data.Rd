\description{
A small selection of the data obtained from the iPortal pipeline for an experiment with perturbations relating to cholesterol regulation. Protein and Peptides have been anonymized as the data is unpublished.\\
The FDR version of the test data contains modified (lowered) decoy peak group m_scores to simulate FDR behaviour of a large dataset.
