\title{
Select all proteins that are supported by peptides.
}
\description{
This functions counts all proteins that are supported by peptides (including non proteo-typic peptides). All peptides (incl. non proteotypic peptides are selected. For the proteins supproted by proteotypic peptide the "1/" in front of the identifier is removed to facilitate further data processing.

\arguments{
  \item{data}{
A data frame containing SWATH data.
}
}
\value{Returns a data frame with the data from both proteotypic and non-proteotypic peptides.}
